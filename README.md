Hi! This repo includes my work with UCLA's StarAI Lab, mentored by Professor Van den Broeck. 
The code is adapted from the lab's MoAT paper (https://starai.cs.ucla.edu/papers/SelvamAISTATS23.pdf), which describes a probabilistic model over spanning trees. 
As the original code only deals with for binary variables, I aim to extend this framework to paramaterize categorical distributions and implement a copula-fitting procedure (Iterated Proportional Fitting Procedure). 
We believe this will reduce computational cost during gradient steps and improve stability in training.
